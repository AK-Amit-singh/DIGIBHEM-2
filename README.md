ðŸ”¹ Task 2 Completed â€“ Online Banking System with GUI in Python ðŸ”¹

As part of my 2-Months internship at Digital Bhem as a Python Programming Intern, I successfully completed Task 2, where I built a fully functional Online Banking System with a graphical user interface using Python and Tkinter.

 What I Did:
 Implemented a user authentication system with login and registration functionality.

 Built account management features, including deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking.

 Created a transaction history log to track all user activities.

 Designed a clean and user-friendly GUI using the Tkinter library.

 Added error handling for cases like invalid inputs and insufficient balance during withdrawal.

 Iâ€™ve also added a screen recording demonstration that shows the full working flow of the system â€” from login to performing transactions.


 Outcome:
A desktop-based Online Banking System that supports multiple users, maintains individual balances and transaction histories, and features a modern, intuitive interface. This task enhanced my skills in GUI design, Python logic building, and user-centric application development.
